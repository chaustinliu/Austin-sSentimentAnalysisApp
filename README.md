# Austin-sSentimentAnalysisApp

Greetings,

The app was supposed to crawl tweets that contain a certain hashtag or view my homepage on Python, and perform sentiment analysis once it is completed. It was for Penn State's honors thesis.

This app needs the Twitter API to collect data for academic purposes.
